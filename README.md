# Android_Malware_Detection
Utilising deep learning to detect android malware. features extracted from AndroidManifest.xml and opcodes from classes.dex.

opcodes are reduced based on a scheme that combines similar opcodes together (eg. Arithmetic = A, branch statements = B etc).
to get a total of 18 unique opcodes.

From the manifest file, we extract all the useful features, then apply feature reduction techniques to reduce the total size. Currently the reduction includes 

1. Correlation Detection and removal. removes ~1000 features from out of 1600
2. Support based removal. removes features which only less than 1% of the applications use while checking for skewed ratio between malware and benign apps. removes around ~300 more features.


the code for generating reduced OPcodes is a modified version of the run_opcode_seq_creation.py taken from https://github.com/niallmcl/Deep-Android-Malware-Detection, with the following citation of the paper. This one parses the generated .smali files to generate the opcode sequences.
