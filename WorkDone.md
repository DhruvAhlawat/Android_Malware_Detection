# Report of the internship (in Mobile Security)

## First Week

- decided on project to work on, while studying machine learning online and doing competitions on kaggle.
- analysed 2 papers already published on android malware detection and utilising a similar machine learning method.
- learnt working with APKTool

## Second Week

- wrote code to generate OPcode sequences in a reduced format. Parses smali code to get the corresponding reduced opcode and writing it out to a file. wrote bash script to run this python file on all the files present in malware and benign folders

- wrote python and bash scripts to extract features from the generated opcode sequence, in an n-gram fashion. Uses frequency of the n-gram opcodes. writes the output in a corresponding csv file

- ran basic machine learning algorithms like random forests and Boosted trees to check if the features was correctly extracted, and got over 90% accuracy, precision and recall.

## Third Week

- modified code meant to extract data from the AndroidManifest.xml file, and wrote bash scripts for it to run on all the required files, while deleting unimportant data after decoding.

- this generated featureset included 1600+ features. Used the following reduction algorithms to reduce the size by more than 90%
	1. Correlation based reduction. (removing features with correlation > 0.95)
	2. Support based reduction. removes features which only occur in less than 1% of our data set. might change this threshold to more to remove more features later (or set up an automatic detection system which checks if accuracy is hampered a lot on removing some features)
	3. a ranking based method, which ranks the features based on (x-y)/(x+y)
	where 
		- x is % of malware samples having this feature
		- y is % of benign samples having this feature
